# Variation in Vulnerability to Vector-borne Disease in the U.S. 


**Project Aim**: Investigate spatial variation and predictors of vulnerability to vector-borne disease in the U.S.

**Next to do:**
- regenerate race data using individual state files (use function to pull these in and bind/ output)
- figure out if any tick-specific vector control agencies missing from Rand et al. list
- Compile dengue data when it comes in
- Add Lyme disease & other tick-borne disease data
- sum vector-borne disease cases (separately for tick and mosquito-borne diseases)
