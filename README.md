# Variation in Vulnerability to Vector-borne Disease in the U.S. 


**Project Aim**: Investigate spatial variation and predictors of vulnerability to vector-borne disease in the U.S.

**Next to do:**
- compiled disease case data (still waiting on Zika data)
- regenerate race data using individual state files (use function to pull these in and bind/ output)
- map Rand et al. table of vector control agencies to fips code
- figure out if any tick-specific vector control agencies missing from Rand et al. list
